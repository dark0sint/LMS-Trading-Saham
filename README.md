##Overview Erika Ramen, Satria Adhi Pradana, Endri ELhanan

I'll guide you through building a basic Learning Management System (LMS) for stock trading using Laravel.
This will include a complete back-end (models, controllers, routes, migrations) and front-end (views with Blade templates).
Platform will feature user authentication, courses on stock trading, modules, lessons, quizzes, and a dashboard.
